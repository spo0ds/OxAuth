## Why OxAuth?

-   To provide users with complete control over their data and privacy, ensuring that they are able to manage and access their personal information as they see fit.

-   To eliminate the need for users to repeatedly fill in the same information, creating a more seamless and efficient experience for users interacting with multiple organizations.

-   To ensure secure interactions between users and third parties, we plan to implement advanced encryption techniques such as AES and RSA, protecting user data from unauthorized access or modification.
